		<strong> The </strong> quick brown bear <em>jumps</em> over the lazy dog, vexing Jack with its dazzling speed. 
		<br /> 
		<strong> Brightly </strong> colored kites flew as bears danced in a whimsical, joyful parade. 
		<br /> 
		<strong> Cool Bear McFly </strong> played his quirky jazz mix on the harmonica beneath a glowing night sky. 
		<br /> 
		<strong> Every </strong> letter zipped into place, forming a paragraph full of alphabetic charm for bears.
